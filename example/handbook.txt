Introduction
------------

This is a silly demo document, not a real manual.

Also, you may want to see the `reference manual`_ (see, that's a link to another manual in assistant)

Here is a demo_ of what restructured text can do.

.. _demo: demo.html

.. _reference manual: reference.html

Keywords
--------

Start :keyword:`quick` with this example!

See how quick is yellow? That's because itÂ´s marked as a :keyword:`keyword`. 
You can see these in the Index tab in assistant. Neat!

BTW: you can also make them NOT be yellow, that's done with the stylesheet.

Configuration
-------------

Look at the nice config :keyword:`dialog` I did for another app:
