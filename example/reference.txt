====================
The Reference Manual
====================

Intro
-----

.. role:: keyword

This is a reference manual. Of course there is nothing in it, 
but the idea is that the example for rst2qhc should show how it handles
multiple rst files.

If you got here from the handbook, you can now `go back`_

.. _go back: handbook.html#introduction

And here are two keywords, so they are not all in one file:

:keyword:`quick`
:keyword:`reference`

That's all for this document
